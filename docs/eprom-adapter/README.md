# 27C322/160/800/400 EPROM Programming Adapter Series

## Introduction

This document covers three generations of adapter:
- **1st gen:** 27C400 only. No configuration jumpers.
- **2nd gen:** 27C400/800/160. Two jumpers (A18-A19)
- **3rd gen:** 27C400/800/160/322, Three jumpers (A18-A20), '322-mode switch.

The supported EPROM parts are:
- **27C400:** 40-pin, 4Mbit (256k x 16-bit, 512k x 8-bit)
- **27C800:** 42-pin, 8Mbit (512k x 16-bit, 1M x 8-bit)
- **27C160:** 42-pin, 16Mbit (1M x 16-bit, 2M x 8-bit)
- **27C322:** 42-pin, 32Mbit (2M x 16-bit, no 8-bit access mode)

The adapter converts the pin-outs of the above parts (which is similar
to contemporary DIP-packaged mask ROMs) to 27C4096 pin-out as
supported by the readily-available and cheap TL866 series of USB
programmers.

## Assembly

If you received a kit of parts for self assembly, refer to the picture
below for a general idea of how things fit together. Note that the 1K
resistor belongs at location R3 (marked 'Base') and that one of the
10K resistors is soldered to the underside of the PCB. Also take care
to install the push switch the correct way round.

## Usage

Insert the programming adapter into the TL866 with the socket
handles adjacent to each other. Insert the EPROM into the
lowest-possible position in the adapter and with pin 1 nearest the
handle.

If your adapter has a 27C322-mode push switch, press it **always and
only** when programming 27C322 parts.

Launch the MiniPro software, select `AMD 27C4096 DIP40` device, and
deselect `Check ID`. You may also optionally reduce `VPP Voltage` to
`12.50V`, depending on your EPROM's datasheet and programming success.

The EPROM can now be accessed as if it were a 27C4096 device, 512kB at
a time, as configured by the bank-switching handled jumpers:
- **27C400:** no need to set jumpers, program all 512kB in one pass.
- **27C800:** program in 2 512kB passes: A18=0 (bank 1), then A18=1 (bank 2)
- **27C160:** program in 4 512kB passes: A19/A18=00,01,10,11 (banks 1,2,3,4)
- **27C322:** program in 8 512kB passes: A20/A19/A18=000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111 (banks 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

## Troubleshooting

If you suffer write or verify errors when programming, try these steps:

1. Make sure the EPROM is fully blank before programming it (`Device
-> Blank Check`). All EPROMs available today are second-hand 'pulls'
and sellers aren't always careful when erasing before resale.

2. Open and close the adapter's ZIF lever a few times, and reposition
the EPROM squarely in the socket.

3. Try adjusting `VPP Voltage` between `12.50V` and
`13.50V`. Subjectively I have had greater success at the higher
voltage and it gives headroom for voltage losses in transferring VPP
through the adapter's logic.

4. Programming errors will occur from time to time, and of course the
chances increase the larger the device. It makes sense to invest in a
UV eraser. These are available at low cost on Ebay from the Far East
for around Â£10-15 ($15-20). Most devices will be erased after 10 to 20
minutes under UV light.
